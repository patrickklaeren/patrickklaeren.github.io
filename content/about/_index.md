Hi, my name is Patrick. I have been a software developer wearing various hats for over a decade, focusing mostly on C# in the .NET ecosystem. I drive development in a bespoke software consultancy and have been a Microsoft MVP since 2021.

This blog is mostly a dump of words, feelings and thoughts. Some tutorials here and there, but mostly a way for me to retain knowledge for my future self. Perhaps you'll find something of interest.

Whenever I'm not reviewing pull requests, I fly planes as a private pilot, grab snooker club, get hit in Airsoft or start projects I'll never finish. I also used to moderate on the [biggest C# Discord server](https://discord/gg/csharp).
